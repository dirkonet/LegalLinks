Simple tool to convert [IITC](https://github.com/jonatkins/ingress-intel-total-conversion) Draw Tools exports to stock Ingress Intel links.

The new Ingress intel map lets you draw links and fields and see blocking links so if you want to export your planned fields from IITC to the normal intel map or want to show your work to others not using IITC, just convert your Draw Tools export to an intel link.
